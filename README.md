## Compiling Java files using Eclipse IDE

1. Download this repository as ZIP
2. Create new `Java Project` in `Eclipse`
3. Right click on your `Java Project` --> `Import`
4. Choose `General` --> `Archive File`
5. Put directory where you downloaded ZIP in `From archive file`
6. Put `ProjectName/src` in `Into folder`
7. Click `Finish`
8. Move `assets` to the root of your project folder i.e. in `ProjectName`

## Running the program

1. Right click on your `Java Project` --> `Run As` --> `Java Application` --> either `RoboGame` or `Parser` (throws an error if it cannot parse a program)
2. See `TestPrograms` directory for the files used to run the robots.
3. This parser needs to be capable of running them so that the robots will do as commanded
